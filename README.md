# Feeder

Building an app to provide food for those in need is a noble endeavor. We stand for supporting the end that stops world hunger and make sure that every plate is filled with a smile:)

Working of the application:
1.)UI is implemented with Flutter based on the designs from Adobe XD.

2.)RESTful APIs using Express.js are used to handle various functionalities:
             User registration and authentication.
             Food donation and retrieval of donation information.
             User profiles and preferences.
             
3.)Socket.io is used to provide real-time updates to users.
            For example, notify users about new food donations, changes in donation status, or when someone nearby needs food urgently.
            
4.)Verbwire API is implemented to provide language translation features.

5.)Users registeration can be done using the app, providing necessary details.

6.)HTTP requests is used to facilitate communication between the Flutter frontend and the Node.js backend.

7.) Database interactions are implemented in the Node.js backend to store and retrieve data from MySQL.
